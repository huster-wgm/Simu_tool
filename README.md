# Simu_tool
Sammary
A simple tool for simple linear or non-linear regression base on Octave/Matlab

HOW TO USE
For everyone who had installed Octave or Matlab,by changing the data in data_x.txt and data data_y.txt,
they can use their own data to get three different regression results:
  1.linear regression (x,y) which will print in figure 1
  2.Polynomial regression(up to x^4 and choose the one with lowest std) with will print in figure 2
  3.Exponential regression (exp(x),y) which will print in figure 3
  
Cost of the regression is defined as:
   COST=1/m*sum[(y(i)-h(x))^2]
   h(x)---hypothesis function
   y(i)---real number ofeach y
   m------total examples number
